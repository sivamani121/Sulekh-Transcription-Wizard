 Our mini project, Transliteration from Hinglish to Hindi, is a web-based appilcation .
 Transliteration is the process of converting text from one script to another. It involves representing the sounds
 of one language using the characters of another language. Transliteration from Hinglish to Hindi is a challenging
 task due to the inherent complexities of the two languages. Hinglish, as the name suggests, is a hybrid of Hindi
 and English, which is widely used in India, especially in informal settings. However, writing Hinglish in the
 Devanagari script, which is used for Hindi, poses significant challenges due to the lack of standardized rules and
 variations in pronunciation and usage.
 To address this problem ,we have developed a web-based application that simplifies the process of transliter
ating Hinglish script to Hindi. The system utilizes machine learning tool to generate multiple responses for every
 word in the sentence along with a custom hindi text box where the users can enter hindi word if he things the 10
 options are not close enough , which are then verified and confirmed by a team of annotators, verifiers, and con
f
 irmers. This three-step verification process ensures the accuracy and consistency of the transliterated text, making
 it more reliable than existing systems.
 The system is designed to be user-friendly and accessible to a wide range of users. Users can log in to the
 portal and request to have Hinglish sentences transcribed into Hindi. The portal includes dashboards for users,
 annotators, verifiers, and confirmers, and task assigner making it easy to track the progress of each transcription
 request.
 The system is built using a combination of AI Bharat AI tool, Django, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which al
lows for scalability and flexibility. The tool can handle large volumes of data and adapt to new language variations,
 making it ideal for organizations that deal with multilingual content on a regular basis.
 Overall, our project aims to make the process of transliterating Hinglish to Hindi more accurate, efficient, and
 accessible to users. The system offers several advantages over existing solutions, including improved accuracy,
 scalability
